This repository contains an implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model integrated with a game environment. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how RL algorithms can be applied to solve decision-making problems in dynamic environments, such as games. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, this project provides a hands-on example of RL in action .

## Overview

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. In this project, we have implemented an RL model and integrated it with a game environment to showcase its capabilities. The game serves as a testbed for training and evaluating the RL agent's performance.

The RL algorithm used in this project is [insert specific algorithm name here, e.g., Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), etc.]. The game environment is [describe the game briefly, e.g., a grid-based world, a platformer, etc.] .

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: A fully functional RL model that interacts with the game environment.
- **Customizable Environment**: The game environment can be modified to test different scenarios and challenges.
- **Visualization Tools**: Includes tools to visualize the agent's decision-making process and performance metrics.
- **Extensible Codebase**: Modular design allows for easy experimentation with different RL algorithms and hyperparameters.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation to help users understand and extend the project.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UnderratedGignac/RLmodel_and_game.git
   cd RLmodel_and_game
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

## Usage

### Training the RL Agent

To train the RL agent, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```

You can customize the training process by modifying the configuration file (`config.yaml`) or passing arguments directly to the script.

### Running the Game

To play the game manually or observe the trained agent in action:
```bash
python play.py
```

### Visualizing Results

After training, you can visualize the agent's performance using:
```bash
python visualize.py
```
